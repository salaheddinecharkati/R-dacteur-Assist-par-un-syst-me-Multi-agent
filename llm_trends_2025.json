  "resume": "In 2025, several key large language models (LLMs) are shaping the AI landscape. Command A from Cohere, requiring only two GPUs, outperforms larger models on business tasks. Gemini 2.5, with its ‘Deep Think’ mode and multimodal capabilities, is prominent, alongside Llama 4 and Mixtral 8x22B. Claude 4’s various series offer specialized strengths.  Shakudo simplifies AI deployment within VPCs, prioritizing security, cost-effectiveness, and automation.",
